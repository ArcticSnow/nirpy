A calibration profile was derived from the camera with Micmac. This calibration profile is for correcting vigneting.
correct image for vignetting (calib profile is of the size of Raw images. Crop from center to use with jpegs
detrend if needed the luminosity, as it can vary linearly from top to bottom of the snowpit
sample targets for absolute reflectance calibration (white= 99%, and grey=50%). Fit a linear model
Convert reflectance image to SSA with the conversion equation  ùëÜùëÜùê¥=ùê¥ùëíùëü/ùë°

Finally, use the ruler (or other object of know size) in image to scale image dimension to metric system.
TODO:

write functions for all steps
wrap all in a python package/class
write function to extract profiles, and maybe later identify layers using reflectance/SSA, and contrast enhanced image
write function to extract SSA profile to import in niviz.org
include class to compute
Raw images are in 12 bit. Find a way to convert to BW from original while maintaining the 12bit resolution. Rawpy might be useful. Then make sure the processing pipeline can accept 12bit data (i.e. all skimage functions)
wrap micmac function to extract profile 'mm3d vodka'. At least provide the method on how to do it.
